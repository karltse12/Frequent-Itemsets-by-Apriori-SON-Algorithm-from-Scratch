# Frequent-Itemsets-by-Apriori-SON-Algorithm-from-Scratch

# Task Details

For this exercise, you will need to rst study the Section 6.4 (up to 6.4.3) of the text-book, Mining Massive Datasets, Leskovec, Rajaraman, Ullman (third edition, 2020), and then follow the instructions below:

1. Implement the simple, randomized algorithm given in Section 6.4.1 of the text-book. 

2. Implement the algorithm of Savasere, Omiecinski, and Navathe (SON al- gorithm), as explained in Section 6.4.3.

3. Compare the two algorithms implemented above on ALL the following datasets: T10I4D100K, T40I10D100K, chess, connect, mushroom, pumsb, pumsb star; those datasets are available at: http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/ 

Report the observed outcomes and comparisons on individual datasets and in overall.

4. Perform different experiments on the simple randomized algorithm, using the following sample sizes: 1%, 2%, 5% and 10%. Compare your experi- mental results. Additionally compare the results of the above experiments with the results produced by the SON algorithm. Your approach should be as efficient as possible in terms of runtime and memory requirements. Report on challenges that you might have come across during the imple- mentation and running the experiments.
